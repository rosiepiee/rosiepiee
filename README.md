HI!!! I'm Rose! A silly girl who yaps and draws a lot.. if you're reading this, you probably saw me on ponytown so, HI! I love making new friends so I don't mind if you come up to chat! (I'm USUALLY scared to start a conversation first)

I don't really care what pronouns you use for me, I prefer she/her but it's not a bother if you want to use he/they, I don't mind at all! ^_^
I'm usually in the Sonic area or chilling near the bakery with my boyfriend! (I LOVE HIM SO MUCH!!!) 
I'm in a lot of fandoms so if you wanna know, check out my strawpages made by my amazing bf!! ‚ù§Ô∏è 

I love scenecore AGHH!!!! I usually listen to 6arelyhuman and Asteria... (plus others!) ü•∫

Dni list is basic, just don't be a weird b!tch. this includes pedos, racists, trans/homophobic people, proshippers, and so on. Idgaf about what you like unless it's BAD... (Why did I get dissed on for liking Bluey? "Dni if bluey fan.." WHAT DID I DO??) Yo Zelda, unfollow me bro... I don't support pedos! You literally have dni danganronpa fans on your profile why did you follow me.. </3

I love Sonic, Danganronpa, MLP, Mortal Kombat, TWDG, Parappa, and more. (Listed in strawpages!)

Online/Looking for chat- HIII!!!

Busy- Using chilling and I don't wanna be bothered (Unless you're my bf, sis, or friends!)

Away- Afk, away from my computer, leave a whisp if you need anything!

(I don't roleplay as it makes me uncomfortable, pls don't ask)
