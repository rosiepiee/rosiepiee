Hii, I'm Rose, you can also call me Rosie or any of my kins (I prefer Shadow but idrc)

she/he, he/she, whatever man. I kinda don't have a preference 😭

The Shadow The Hedgehog, Amy Rose, and Gundham Tanaka kinnie. I am them, I take it seriously.. 😔 /hj

My Fandoms: Sonic (Main), Danganronpa, TWDG, MLP, Mortal Kombat, Parappa, Yansim (I DO NOT SUPPORT YANDEV), MHA, COD Zombies, Creepypastas, Exe, and probably more.

6/4 💙🩷 I LOVE MY BABY!!! THEY ARE SO AWESOME AND I LOVE THEM A LOT!! (The amount of times people flirt on pt..? HELLO..?)

I love Sonadow, Sonamy, and Soudam, they are my comfort ships! AGHH! If it bothers you, okay! They're mine not yours! 🤗

DNI: A literal CHILD, proshippers, hazbin fans and skins, (I was in it, never going back..), rude ass people, and just anything problematic. I hide freely, especially if what you are saying or doing urks me.

BYI: I cuss a lot (Not in a hazbin way.. just a warning), I can be hyper, I have trust/attachment issues, mood swings, anxiety, suspected depression, and small anger issues. I cannot pick a struggle. (I am trying to be better though)

Once you talk to me about Caseoh, Impractical Jokers, or any of my listed ships and fandoms, I will not shut up..
