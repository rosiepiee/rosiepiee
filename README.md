HI!!! I'm Rose! A silly girl who yaps and draws a lot.. if you're reading this, you probably saw me on ponytown so, HI! I love making new friends so I don't mind if you come up to chat! (I'm USUALLY scared to start a conversation first)

I don't really care what pronouns you use for me, I prefer she/her but it's not a bother if you want to use he/they, I don't mind at all! ^_^
I'm usually in the Sonic area or chilling near the bakery with my boyfriend! (I LOVE HIM SO MUCH!!!) 
I'm in a lot of fandoms so if you wanna know, check out my strawpages made by my amazing bf!! ‚ù§Ô∏è 

I love scenecore AGHH!!!! I usually listen to 6arelyhuman and Asteria... (plus others!) ü•∫

Dni list is basic, just don't be a weird b!tch. this includes pedos, racists, transphobic/homophobic people, proshippers, and so on. Idgaf about what you like unless it's BAD... (Why did I get dissed on for liking Bluey? "Dni if bluey fan.." WHAT DID I DO??)

I love Sonic, Danganronpa, MLP, Mortal Kombat, TWDG, Parappa, and more. (Listed in strawpages!)

Looking for chat- HIII!!!

Busy- Usually chilling and I don't wanna be bothered (Unless you're my bf, sis, or friends!) If you come up to me and idk you, expect little to no replies, no hard feelings! <3

Away- Afk or just doing something.. leave a whisp if you need anything!

(I don't roleplay as it makes me uncomfortable, pls don't ask)

Amy Rose, Sonia Nevermind, Sayaka Maizono, and Mikan Tsumiki (main) kinnie btw..

Don't flirt.. even as a joke, I'm happily taken, thank you.
