HI!!! I'm Rose! A silly girl who yaps and draws a lot.. if you're reading this, you probably saw me on ponytown so, HI! I love making new friends so I don't mind if you come up to chat! 


I don't really care what pronouns you use for me, I prefer she/her but it's not a bother if you want to use he/they, I don't mind at all! ^_^
I'm usually in the Sonic area or chilling near the bakery with my boyfriend! (I LOVE HIM SO MUCH!!!) 
I'm in a lot of fandoms so if you wanna know, check out my strawpages made by my amazing bf!! (He's so talented, omg ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è) 

I love scenecore AGHH!!!! I usually listen to 6arelyhuman and Asteria... (plus others!) 

Dni list is basic, just don't be a weird b!tch. this includes pedos, racists, transphobic/homophobic people, proshippers, and so on. Idgaf about what you like unless it's BAD... (Why did I get dissed on for liking Bluey? "Dni if bluey fan.." WHAT DID I DO??)

I love Sonic, Danganronpa, MLP, Mortal Kombat, TWDG, Parappa, and more. (Listed in strawpages!)

Looking for chat- HIII!!!

Busy- Usually chilling and I don't wanna be bothered (Unless you're my bf, sis, or friends!) If you come up to me and idk you, expect little to no replies, no hard feelings! <3 (I realized this is hard for me cause I'm nice so I MIGHT talk to you depeneding on your vibe but I mainly wanna chill.. üò≠)
