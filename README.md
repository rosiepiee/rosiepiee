Multifandoms, just check my strawpage.

I collect my kins like pokemon, i see myself in so many characters /silly

I love love sonamy, its my comfort ship (I pass Sonic around at this point.. I ship him with so many characters.. LEGALLY!!!)

I love my bf so so much, i loveee hiiimm!

i love making friends, pls dont hesitate to say hi to me, im just nervous when saying something first unless its to crown you..

byi, my mental health is extremely wonky. I have anxiety, suspected depression, mood swings, trust issues, attachment issues, and my brain can take a while to understand something, I also tend to apologize over very small things which is unfortunately out of my control.. pls pls try to be nice as im trying really hard.

I can be a hyper and cheerful person but my brain is weird so if I feel like I did something wrong or hurt you, I will probably distant myself or stay silent.

I love pink things so much.

remaking this when i have more energy.
