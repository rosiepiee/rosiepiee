HI!!! I'm Rose! A silly girl who yaps and draws a lot.. if you're reading this, you probably saw me on ponytown so, HI! I love making new friends so I don't mind if you come up to chat! 


I don't know if this makes any sense but I use he/any pronouns!! I'm aware that I'm a girl, but I'd prefer he/him! Any works though! ^_^

I'm usually in the Sonic area or chilling near the bakery with my boyfriend! (I LOVE HIM SO MUCH!!!) 
I'm in a lot of fandoms so if you wanna know, check out my strawpages made by my amazing bf!! (He's so talented, omg 🥺❤️) 

I love scenecore AGHH!!!! I usually listen to 6arelyhuman and Asteria... (plus others!) 

Dni list is basic, just don't be a weird b!tch. this includes pedos, racists, transphobic/homophobic people, proshippers, and so on. Idgaf about what you like unless it's BAD... (Why did I get dissed on for liking Bluey? "Dni if bluey fan.." WHAT DID I DO??)

I love Sonic, Danganronpa, MLP, Mortal Kombat, TWDG, Parappa, and more. (Listed in strawpages!)

99.9% of the time, I'll be on busy. I love making new friends, especially with similar interests but I'm usually on pt to chill with my friends and boyfriend. You can send whispers but just know I can be pretty awkward and can miss em at times. When I'm afk (I'll be on away) You can still send me em and I'll get em when I'm back! ^_^

(I don't roleplay as it makes me uncomfortable, pls don't ask)

Amy Rose, Shuichi Saihara, and Sonia Nevermind kinnie!!!!

Don't flirt.. even as a joke pls..... I LOVE MY BF!!!!!

"This is nothing to LOL about..!"
